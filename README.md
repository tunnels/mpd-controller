mpd controler
====
An alfred workflow for running a colection of helper scripts for mpd/mpc. Requires mpd and mpc (obviously).

The keyword is "m".

"add random album" and "add random songs" both require shuf (part of gnu/coreutils: OS X users can get it through homebrew with, "brew install coreutils")
